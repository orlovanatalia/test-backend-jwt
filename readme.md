Before you start you have to launch `mongod` command in terminal
> there are a lot of tutorial how to install `mongo`

1. duplicate .env.example file and rename it to .env
2. install packages with command `yarn`
3. run project with command `yarn dev`

This is my own code. You can use it as you wish. But libs, images and so on - in accordance with their license
